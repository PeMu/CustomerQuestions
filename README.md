#Customer Questions

##Want to keep track of all the questions clients asks in your website?

The best way is to answer directly on it!

This is a module for storing those emails as dataobjects with the ability to answer those directly in the module. The client will get a branded email from your website and you will keep record of all emails ever received. What a great deal! isn't it?

## Requirements ##

This module requires [Silverstripe 3](http://silverstripe.org/download) and [UncleCheese's dashboard module](https://github.com/unclecheese/silverstripe-dashboard)

## Installation ##
Just as any other silverstripe module, drag it into the root folder, run dev/build, and you are done. In the left menu of your site you will find a "Customer Questions" section for keeping track of all of the questions clients have sent to the website.

then you need to create a ContactPage and set the email you want to get the messages and the thank you message

## Usage ##

With this module you'll get a simple Contact form tied to a dashboard that shows you the latest unanswered questions on your site, you can check the questions and even answer them directly from the cms without using your email program, you just write your answer in the module and it will send a branded email to your customer.

You also have a nice admin to review all the questions other clients have asked historically.

I hope you enjoy it. [Like us in facebook for more exiting modules!](https://www.facebook.com/dospuntocero.cl)

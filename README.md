##Overview

This is a simple module for adding dataobject as pages functionality on silverstripe 3, can be used for news, products or anything you can think of that doesnt need to appear in the sitetree. If you have an object that you will create more than 20, i believe that this module is better than using Pages, because of the way the sitetree works and maybe because of performance (large sitetree its slower than a datalist).

## Requirements ##

This module requires Silverstripe 3 and UncleCheese's dashboard module

## Installation ##
Just as any other silverstripe module, drag it into the root folder, run dev/build, and you are done. In the left menu of your site you will find an "Articles" section for adding/editing Article Objects.

## Usage ##

With this module you get a simple Contact form tied to a dashboard that shows you the latest unanswered questions on your site, you can check the questions and even answer them directly from the cms without using your email program. 
You also have a nice admin to review all the questions other clients have asked historically.

I hope you enjoy it. [Like us in facebook for more exiting modules!](https://www.facebook.com/dospuntocero.cl)
